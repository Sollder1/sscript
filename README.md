# sscript
A simple language, that gets compiled into java code by using a java program.
This project has NO practical use and is more of a personal challenge and learning opportunity than anything else.


## Capabilities
The language only allows for one file with a set of functions.
Where as one method is the Entrypoint for the application (just like in Java).


The Language currently is in the specification phase.
